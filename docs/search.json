This timeline was produced as educational material for the CMI-PB project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMI-PB\nwww.cmi-pb.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Epidemic Reported\nThe oldest known pertussis epidemic is thought to be the Paris outbreak of 1578. This was documented in detail by the French physician Guillaume de Baillou who described the classic symptoms of the disease.\n\nRead more\n\n\n1578\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Name \"Pertussis\" First Appears\nThe name pertussis (from Latin for \"intensive cough\") was first introduced by the English physician Thomas Sydenham in 1670. This name took over by the end of the decade. Earlier names included hooping cough, tusis perennis, tussis epidemica infantum, and tusis quinta.\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n1679\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery of Bordetella pertussis\nIn 1900, Jules Bordet along with Octave Gengou observed a small ovoid bacterium in the sputum of a 5-month old child suffering from pertussis. However, the discovery remained questionable, as the organism was unable to be isolated and cultivated on ordinary ascitic agar or blood agar plates.\n\n1900\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCausative Bacteria Isolated\nSix years later, Bordet and Gengou succeeded in making a special medium, called Bordet-Gengou (BG) medium, which proved to be key for isolating the bacteria for the first time. It was eventually named Bordetella pertussis in honor of Bordet.\n\n1906\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-vaccine Era\nIn early 1920s and 1930s pertussis was one of the most common childhood diseases and a major cause of childhood mortality. In the U.S. alone there were often over 250,000 cases per year and up to 9,000 deaths. \n\n1921\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst US Vaccine Developed\nDr. Louis S. Sauer developed an early pertussis vaccine made from killed whole-cell B. pertussis at Evanstion Hospital, a suburb of Chicago. Dr. Sauer never asked for compensation for developing vaccines and told an interviewer later, \"One doesn't do that thing for money.\"\n\n1931\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Whole-cell Pertussis Vaccine Tested on a Wide Scale\nDanish physician Thorvald Madsen tested a whole-cell pertussis vaccine on a wide scale for the first time reporting promising results. \n\n1935\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst DPT Vaccine\nPearl Kendrick at the Michigan Department of Health combined a refined whole-cell pertussis vaccine with Diphtheria and Tetanus toxoids to create the first combination DPT vaccine. \n\n1942\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoutine Vaccination\nIn 1944, the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests routine use of pertussis vaccine and, in 1947, recommends its use in the form of the DPT combination. Routine childhood vaccination begins and is made made compulsory in some states by the end of the decade.\n\n1947\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecline of Whooping Cough\nThere was a massive decline of pertussis cases in the U.S and other countries with mass vaccination programs. In the U.S cases fall by over 99%. \n\n1970\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControversy\nIn the 1970s and 1980s there was a lot of controversy towards the DPT vaccine relating to the question of whether or not it caused potential brain damage. \n\n1975\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawsuits\nDue to lawsuits of the unscientific claims about the DPT vaccine in the 1980's, it led to many manufacturers to stop making the vaccine. \n\n1980\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreation of DTaP Vaccine\nJapanese scientist Yugi Sato created an acellular pertussis vaccine that contained purified haemagglutinins from B. Pertussis. This aP vaccine was first used in Japan soon after and was demonstrated to have fewer side effects than the whole-cell (wP) vaccine. It was later used in other countries (with additional components of B. Pertussis) as the combined DTaP vaccine. \n\nRead more\n\n\n1981\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"DPT: Vaccine Roulette\"\nIn 1982 negative publicity was encouraged from a documentary called \"DPT: Vaccine Roulette\", which led to a massive amount of lawsuits against the vaccine manufacturers. This documentary depicted the lives of children whose severe disabilities were incorrectly blamed on the DPT vaccine.\n\nRead more\n\n\n1982\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiability\nBy 1984 DPT vaccine manufacturers had a hard time obtaining liability insurance. By the end of the year, only one DPT manufacturer remained. Scientists respond by ramping up development and testing of safer new acellular pertussis vaccines. These would replace the older whole cell vaccine in many countries with a decade.  \n\n1984\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPertussis On The Rise Again\nPertussis cases in the U.S. started to increase steadily as vaccine uptake declines. Misinformation and vaccine hesitancy pose serious treats to pubic health. \n\n1985\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Childhood Vaccine Injury Act\nIn 1986 Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA). In hopes to avert the vaccine crisis. It was made to establish a federal no-fault system to compensate to those hurt by the vaccine. \n\n1986\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Myth\" and \"Nonsense\"\nLater studies showed that their was no connection between the DPT vaccine and the permanent brain damage. It was in fact called a \"Myth\" and \"Nonsence\" by the Journal of American Medical Association in 1990. \n\n1990\n\n\n\n\n\n\naP Vaccine Approved in the U.S.\nThe acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine was approved in the U.S in 1992, the the older wP formalization was phased out and completely replaced with the DTaP vaccine combination in 1996. \n\n1992\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPertussis Outbreaks\nMajor pertussis epidemics and outbreaks are once again a major public health concern. With epidemics typically occurring every 3 to 5 years in the U.S. as was evident in the pre-vaccine years.  TO FINISH mention CA outbreak.\n\n2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMI-PB Project\nA new systems vaccinology project is launced that combines systems biology and genomics to provide a more holistic picture of protective pertussis-specific immune mechanisms. The project provides the scientific community with comprehensive, high-quality, and freely accessible resources related to Pertussis booster vaccination.These resources, and associated prediction challenges, are geared towards engaging both experts and enthusiasts in developing and improving computational models of the immune response to vaccination and in turn informing new intervention strategies to curb the increasing frequency of B. pertussis infection.\n\n\n2020"

Pertussis can infect people of all ages but is most severe and life threatening for infants under a year old (Healy et al. 2015). This is due to both the small size of their airways and because they are too young to have completed their full course of vaccinations.\nTransmission occurs primarily through bacteria laden respiratory droplets produced when an infected individual coughs and sneezes (Warfel, Beren, and Merkel 2012).

Once the bacterial concentration increases, damage to the respiratory tract causes the first mild symptoms. These mimic a common cold including a runny nose, low-grade fever, and a cough. This is called the catarrhal phase and it lasts about two weeks (Figure 2). At this point, pertussis is very contagious due to the presence of a high concentration of bacteria in the respiratory tract that makes them easy to aerosolize.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Pertussis develops in three phases. The catarrhal phase (associated with cold-like symptoms, such as runny nose, mild cough, low-grade fever, or sneezing). The paroxysmal phase (associated with the most severe symptoms including uncontrollable coughing fits), and finally the convalescent or recovery phase.\n\n\nThe catarrhal phase is followed by the more severe paroxysmal phase, which lasts another one to six weeks. Even though the immune system is killing and clearing the bacteria during this phase, symptoms persist from the damage caused by their released toxins. The most notable symptoms include paroxysms (uninterrupted coughing fits) followed by difficulty breathing. The violent force of these paroxysms can cause vomiting, a collapsed lung and broken ribs. Rather than having violent coughing fits or making a whooping noise, really young infants often have gasping, cyanosis and life threatening apnea (pauses in breathing). These symptoms typically persist for several weeks. Finally, the convalescent phase begins, which lasts between two to three weeks, during which the cough slowly improves, the paroxysms and whooping fade away, and the airway heals. It is best to diagnose pertussis during the early catarrhal phase as treatment with antibiotics is most effective during this time."

    "section": "History",
    "text": "History\nThe first pertussis epidemic was reported in Paris in the year 1578 (Holmes 1940) (James D. Cherry 2015). The French physician Guillaume de Baillou studied this epidemic with his observations published posthumously in 1640 (Figure 3). In the British Isles, the illness was called “the kink” (a Scottish term for fit or paroxysm), and in Northern Europe it was known as “kindhoest” (a Teutonic word for child cough) (J. D. Cherry 1999a). Other early names include hooping cough, tusis perennis, tussis epidemica infantum, and tussis quinta (James D. Cherry 2015) (J. D. Cherry 1999a).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Guillaume de Baillou (Latin: Ballonius) lived from 1538 to 1616 and is credited with providing the first clinical description of pertussis.Credit: Portrait of Guillaume de Baillou. Wellcome Collection. Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\n\n\n\nTO DO: Quote Baillou’s early description text, which is rather graphic and and still holds true for the disease today. Include the timeline history with link-out (“read more”) covering these interesting historical notes.\n\nThe name pertussis (from the Latin for “intensive cough”) was first introduced in England in 1679 (Lapin 1943). Working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1900, Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou observed the causative bacteria in the sputum of a patient with pertussis, and in 1906 they reported its first isolation (Bordet and Gengou 1906). It was then named Bordet-Gengou bacillus, later Haemophilus pertussis, and finally Bordetella pertussis. During this period of the 20th century pertussis was one of the most common childhood diseases and a major cause of childhood mortality (J. D. Cherry 1999b). In the United States alone there were often more than 200,000 cases reported annually (“Pertussis Surveillance: Cases by Year (CDC)” 2023a). This figure is likely an underestimate as pertussis, even today, remains underreported and misdiagnosed.\nSince pertussis was such a devastating disease, vaccine development was considered soon after B. pertussis isolation. In the 1930s, Pearl Kendrick and Grace Elderling, working at the Michigan Department of Health laboratory, developed an effective chemically inactivated whole-cell vaccine (Kendrick and Eldering 1936) (Shapiro-Shapin 2010). The vaccine became widely available in the United States in 1940 and was approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1943 (Shapiro-Shapin 2010). Five years later a combination vaccine that included diphtheria and tetanus toxoids in addition to inactivated B. pertussis (so called “DTwP” vaccine) was first licensed and became the formulation of choice until 1992 (Pittman 1991). This vaccine was highly effective with the reported annual incidence of pertussis dropping from a high of 150–250 cases/100,000 persons (&gt;200,000 cases) to a low of 0.5 cases/100,000 (&lt;1,000 cases) after widespread vaccination (“Pertussis Surveillance: Cases by Year (CDC)” 2023b).\nThe history of human interaction with Bordetella pertussis is in our view fascinating. As described in our supplementary timeline figure it touches on major milestones in the development of immunology, large scale vaccination programs, and sadly growing public missinformation and vaccine hesitancy."

    "section": "Pertussis vaccines",
    "text": "Pertussis vaccines\nPertussis vaccination is, in general, highly effective at preventing the disease. The first generation of pertussis vaccines were whole-cell vaccines (wP). These used inactivated B. pertussis cells to stimulate an immune response and subsequent immunity (Figure 4).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Whole-cell pertussis vaccines are inactivated bacteria with many antigens, including endotoxins, which trigger broad immunity. The acellular vaccines use only a few antigens (see Table 1), including a weakened pertussis toxin, to limit side effects.\n\n\nThe wP vaccines proved highly effective in reducing the incidence of severe disease. During the 6-year period from 1940 through 1945, more than 1 million cases of pertussis were reported, an average of 175,000 cases per year (approximately 150 cases per 100,000 population) (“Pertussis Surveillance: Cases by Year (CDC)” 2023b). Following wP vaccine introduction in 1945, pertussis incidence gradually declined, reaching 15,000 reported cases in 1960 (approximately 8 per 100,000 population). By 1970, annual incidence was fewer than 5,000 cases per year and, between 1980 and 1990, an average of 2,900 cases per year were reported (approximately 1 per 100,000 population) (Figure 5). Despite these successes, early wP vaccines were mired in controversy due to their association with adverse events, including fever, local reactions at the injection site, and in rare cases, neurological complications 5,13,14. This led to reduced public acceptance and uptake of the vaccine necessitating the need for safer alternatives.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Pertussis cases by year in the United States (1922-2019) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dashed lines indicate the introduction of wP vaccines (DTP) and the conversion to aP vaccines (DTaP and Tdap) in 1946 and 2008, respectively. In the pre-vaccine era (before 1946) pertussis was a much more common disease and a major cause of infant mortality. Introduction of the first pertussis vaccination in 1946 resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of yearly cases from &gt; 200,000 in the 1940s to &lt; 2,000 in the 1970s. However, it is also clear from the CDC data that pertussis cases are once again increasing. For example, we can see that in 2012 the CDC reported 48,277 cases of pertussis in the United States. This is the largest number of cases reported since 1955. Source: CDC. National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, 2019.\n\n\n\nThe switch to acellular pertussis vaccines\nTraditional whole cell vaccines are reactogenic causing fever and local reactions in many vaccines (Decker and Edwards 2021a). To address this issue in the 1980s and 1990s, acellular pertussis vaccines (aP) were introduced, consisting of up to five purified antigens of B. pertussis (Figure 4 and Table 1). The rationale behind this development was to reduce the risk of adverse events by eliminating unnecessary bacterial components while maintaining the vaccine’s efficacy. Indeed, these vaccines demonstrated a superior safety profile compared to their whole-cell counterparts (Cody et al. 1981). These aP vaccine formulations have subsequently been adopted in most Western countries including the United States.\n\n\naP vaccine composition\nThe current aP vaccine used in the United States is part of combination vaccines that include immunization against tetanus and diphtheria (the T and D in Table 2). The two primary vaccines differ in their relative concentrations of these components and are called DTaP and Tdap (for diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis). DTaP is intended for children under 7 years of age and Tdap for older children and adults. This later Tdap vaccine contains lower doses of diphtheria and pertussis antigens and is typically intended to reinforce immunity (i.e. as a boost vaccine). The pertussis portion of these vaccines typically contain purified pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), fimbriae (FIM) and pertactin (PRN) protein antigens (see Table 1 and Figure 4). These components work in concert to stimulate the immune system to produce a response that will be effective against infection. By including multiple antigens, the vaccine can provide broader protection against different strains of B. pertussis that might vary in the expression of these components. It’s worth noting that the specific formulation of aP vaccines can vary by manufacturer and country. For instance, some formulations might not include all the components listed above, but the vaccines used in the United States generally include all four (Table 2).\n\n\nTable 2: Major pertussis vaccines used in the USA along their trade names and relative antigen concentrations for the major pertussis derived components. These include: PT = pertussis toxin, FHA = filamentous hemagglutinin, PRN = pertactin, FIM 2+3 = fimbriae types 2 and 3. Note the reduced concentrations for Tdap booster vaccines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine Type\nTrade Name\nManufacturers\nComponents\nConcentrations\n\n\n\n\nDTaP\nDaptacel\nSanofi Pasteur\nDetoxified PT\n10 µg\n\n\n\n\n\nFHA\n5 µg\n\n\n\n\n\nPertactin\n3 µg\n\n\n\n\n\nFIM\n5 µg\n\n\n\nInfanrix\nGlaxoSmithKline\nInactivated PT\n25 µg\n\n\n\n\n\nFHA\n25 µg\n\n\n\n\n\nPertactin\n8 µg\n\n\n\nPentacel\nSanofi Pasteur\nDetoxified PT\n20 µg\n\n\n\n\n\nFHA\n20 µg\n\n\n\n\n\nPertactin\n3 µg\n\n\n\n\n\nFIM\n5 µg\n\n\nTdap\nAdacel\nSanofi Pasteur\nDetoxified PT\n2.5 µg\n\n\n\n\n\nFHA\n5 µg\n\n\n\n\n\nPertactin\n3 µg\n\n\n\n\n\nFIM\n5 µg\n\n\n\nBoostrix\nGlaxoSmithKline\nInactivated PT\n8 µg\n\n\n\n\n\nFHA\n8 µg\n\n\n\n\n\nPertactin\n2.5 µg"

Data source: CDC. National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, 2023.\n\n\nThere are likely multiple factors contributing to this recent significant increase in the incidence of pertussis. These include changes in diagnostic testing, heightened recognition and reporting of pertussis cases, and mutation of the bacteria. However, these have not been supported by genetic, experimental and epidemiological data [ref]. The main hypothesis therefore to explain this phenomenon is the apparent waning of vaccine-induced immunity in infants primed with aP compared to wP in countries, including the United States, that have transitioned to acellular vaccines. However, it is currently unclear why these newer aP vaccines might be less effective long term than their older wP counterparts.\n\nThe differences in immune responses: aP vs. wP priming\nAlthough aP vaccines exhibit fewer adverse reactions and provide good protection in the first few years after vaccination (Decker and Edwards 2021b), the duration of protection appears to be shorter than expected. Specifically, an increase in pertussis outbreaks has been reported in various countries that switched from wP to aP vaccines (Decker and Edwards 2021b) (Diavatopoulos and Edwards 2017). Many of these outbreaks occurred among children who only received aP vaccines. As a result, multiple studies about waning immunity post-aP vaccination have been conducted (Klein et al. 2012) (Klein et al. 2016) (Witt et al. 2013) (Gambhir et al. 2015). These include the characterization of differences in the immune response against aP and wP vaccines (Wilk et al. 2019) (Ross et al. 2013) (Lee et al. 2018) (Silva Antunes et al. 2018) (Silva Antunes et al. 2020) (Silva Antunes et al. 2021) (Schure et al. 2013) (Schure et al. 2012). These have noted differences in polarization and proliferation of T cell responses in adults originally vaccinated (primed) with aP vs. wP (Aase et al. 2014) (Silva Antunes et al. 2018) (Figure 7). However, it remains unclear how this difference in immune responses is maintained over time between aP and wP primed vaccinees, despite subsequent Tdap booster vaccination.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Differences in the human immune response to Tdap booster vaccination associated with wP vs aP priming in infancy. Source: 29920186\n\n\nBeyond these observations further study is required to better understand the type of immune responses that yield optimal, long-lasting protection and the underlying mechanisms responsible for this protection."

    "text": "Next steps in the era of systems vaccinology\nWhy is this vaccine-preventable disease on the upswing and how can we effectively respond to limit pertussis outbreaks? Clearly, further research is needed to fully elucidate the causes of waning protection before the best pathway forward can be determined. In particular, more complete data on host responses to vaccination and infection are needed to help design the most effective vaccine and vaccination program.\nNew approaches such as systems vaccinology, that combine systems biology and genomics, are ideally placed to provide a more holistic picture of protective pertussis-specific immune responses. In this vein, the new and ongoing CMI-PB project (Shinde et al. 2023) aims to provide the scientific community with this very information and evaluate differences over time in wP and aP vaccinated individuals (Figure 8). This project integrates different biological readouts including transcriptomic, proteomic, and cytometric data to broadly define the immune state of large groups of individuals, and to define changes in a pre- and post-vaccine setting. In particular, CMI-PB tracks and makes freely available long-term humoral and cellular immune response data for a large number of individuals who received either DTwP or DTaP combination vaccines in infancy followed by Tdap booster vaccinations.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: The CMI-PB tracks and makes freely available long-term humoral and cellular immune response data for a large number of individuals who received either DTwP or DTaP combination vaccines in infancy followed by Tdap booster vaccinations.\n\n\n\nCMI-PB project\nCollectively, this data comprise a comprehensive, high-quality, and freely accessible resource regarding Pertussis booster vaccination. Critically, the CMI-PB project encourages community participation through so-called “computational prediction challenges” (Figure 9). These prediction challenges serve as a platform for testing and improving computational models of immunity, encouraging collaboration and discussion, and ultimately advancing the understanding of immune responses to vaccinations. The challenges are open to various labs, researchers, and, in later challenges, members of the public.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Every year, CMI-PB host an open contest that challenges participants to predict the immune responses of 20 individuals after pertussis booster vaccination.\n\n\nThese prediction challenges (Figure 9) are designed to stimulate collaborative efforts, enabling faster advancement in scientific knowledge than could be achieved by individual groups. CMI-PB generates experimental data explicitly for model evaluation. This data is released annually, and associated contests are organized to evaluate the performance of computational models developed by participating teams. Participants are given a list of questions related to predicting immune responses, with the predictions to be made in the form of ranking readouts from the highest to the lowest response in the tested donors. The predictions are evaluated by independent researchers using statistical methods like Spearman correlation and ROC curve analysis. This approach facilitates constructive discussions between modelers and experimentalists based on transparent metrics. Through these challenges, the CMI-PB project aims to address common challenges in developing computational models for biological applications, such as testing their generalizability and predictive performance, especially in the face of high-dimensional data and inter-individual variability. The challenges are organized annually, with the inaugural challenge having taken place in May 2022. The project commits to organizing four annual challenges, with each subsequent challenge aiming to engage a broader segment of the scientific community and the public (Table 3).\n\n\nTable 3: CMI-PB runs annual prediction challenges with initial rounds of testing followed by open iterations using new experimental data that are generated each year for community model and prediction evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\nParticipants\nSize of training dataset\nSize of test dataset\nCurrent status\n\n\n\n\n\nDry Run\n\nCMI-PB consortium\n60 (28 aP, 32 wP)\n36 (19 aP, 17 wP)\nConcluded May 2022\n\n\n\nInvited\n\nInvited experts\n96 (47 aP, 49 wP)\n23 (13 aP, 10 WP)\nAnnounced Aug 2023\n\n\n\nOpen\n\nPublic\n119 (60 aP, 59 wP)\n32 (16 aP, 16 WP)\nAnnounced Jan 2024\n\n\n\nOpen\n\nPublic\n151 (76 aP, 85 wP)\n32 (16 aP, 16 wP)\nAnnounced Dec 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning more about CMI-PB\nFurther introducing and describing the CMI-PB project is the subject of our next vignette.

    "text": "2. A tale of two vaccines (wP & aP)\nTwo types of pertussis vaccines have been developed: whole-cell pertussis (wP) and acellular pertussis (aP). The first vaccines were composed of ‘whole cell’ (wP) inactivated bacteria. The latter aP vaccines use purified antigens of the bacteria (the most important pertussis components for our immune system, see Figure 2). These aP vaccines were developed to have less side effects than the older wP vaccines and are now the only form administered in the United States.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Whole-cell pertussis vaccines are inactivated bacteria with many antigens, including endotoxins, which trigger broad immunity. The acellular vaccines use only a few antigens, including a weakened pertussis toxin, to limit side effects.\n\n\n\nSide-note: Currently in United States aP vaccines are administered to infants in combination with those for diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) in the so-called DTaP vaccine combination. A distinct Tdap formulation, with reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis, is administered as a boost for preteens, teens, and adults.\n\nFor motivated readers there is a nice historical account of the wP to aP vaccine switch in the US in Klein (2014) (Klein 2014)\nLet’s return to our CDC data plot and examine what happened after the switch to the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccination program.\n\n\nQ2. Using the ggplot geom_vline() function add lines to your previous plot for the 1946 introduction of the wP vaccine and the 1996 switch to aP vaccine (see example in the hint below). What do you notice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYour plot should look something like the one below where we take our plot from Q1 and minimally add two geom_vline(xintercept=___) function calls. Here I also add optional text labels with geom_text() to help annotate the lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3. Describe what happened after the introduction of the aP vaccine? Do you have a possible explanation for the observed trend?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear from the CDC data that pertussis cases are once again increasing. For example, we can see that in 2012 the CDC reported 48,277 cases of pertussis in the United States. This is the largest number of cases reported since 1955, when 62,786 cases were reported. The pertussis field has several hypotheses for the resurgence of pertussis including (in no particular order): 1) more sensitive PCR-based testing, 2) vaccination hesitancy 3) bacterial evolution (escape from vaccine immunity), 4) waning of immunity in adolescents originally primed as infants with the newer aP vaccine as compared to the older wP vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey-point: Despite high levels of acellular pertussis (aP) vaccination, the United States and other countries are now experiencing a significant resurgence in pertussis cases with large outbreaks now once again a major public health concern.\n\n Additional points for discussion: How are vaccines currently approved? \n\n\n\nTypically we first examine ‘Correlates of protection’ which are things that can be measured within weeks or months after vaccination, and which are thought to correlate with increased protection from disease. For the aP vaccine this was an induction of antibodies against pertussis toxin (PT) in infants at equivalent levels to those induced by the wP vaccine. The aP vaccines also had less side effects (reduction of sore arms, fever and pain).\n\n\nTesting for protection induced by a new vaccine requires a lot of people exposed to the pathogen (like in a pandemic).\n\n\nIt is impossible to discover a effect 10 years post vaccination in the current trial system.\n\n\nIt is unclear what differentiates people that have been primed with aP vs. wP long term.\n\n\nThe CMI-PB project is an attempt to make data on this question open and examinable by all."

    "text": "3. Exploring CMI-PB data\nWhy is this vaccine-preventable disease on the upswing? To answer this question we need to investigate the mechanisms underlying waning protection against pertussis. This requires evaluation of pertussis-specific immune responses over time in wP and aP vaccinated individuals.\nThe new and ongoing CMI-PB project aims to provide the scientific community with this very information. In particular, CMI-PB tracks and makes freely available long-term humoral and cellular immune response data for a large number of individuals who received either DTwP or DTaP combination vaccines in infancy followed by Tdap booster vaccinations. This includes complete API access to longitudinal RNA-Seq, AB Titer, Olink, and live cell assay results directly from their website: https://www.cmi-pb.org/\n\nKey-point: For the CMI-PB project a booster shot is a proxy for what happens when you get infected.\n\n\nThe CMI-PB API returns JSON data\nThe CMI-PB API (like most APIs) sends responses in JSON format. Briefly, JSON data is formatted as a series of key-value pairs, where a particular word (“key”) is associated with a particular value. An example of the JSON format for Ab titer data is shown below:\n{\n\"specimen_id\":1,\n \"isotype\":\"IgG\",\n \"is_antigen_specific\":true,\n \"antigen\":\"PT\",\n \"ab_titer\":68.5661390514946,\n \"unit\":\"IU/ML\",\n \"lower_limit_of_detection\":0.53\n } \n\nTo read these types of files into R we will use the read_json() function from the jsonlite package. Note that if you want to do more advanced querys of APIs directly from R you will likely want to explore the more full featured rjson package. The big advantage of using jsonlite for our current purposes is that it can simplify JSON key-value pair arrays into R data frames without much additional effort on our part.\n\n# Allows us to read, write and process JSON data\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nLet’s now read the main subject database table from the CMI-PB API.
