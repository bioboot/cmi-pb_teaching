<p class="mb-0">The oldest known pertussis epidemic is thought to be the Paris outbreak of 1578. This was documented in detail by the French physician Guillaume de Baillou who described the classic symptoms of the disease.</p>

These include multiple outbreaks in 15th century Persia, Korea and China. However, these were not reported in sufficient detail as to be unequivocally assigned to Pertussis.</br></br>

<div>Indeed, diseases with the classic symptoms of Pertussis are absent in reports from Greek and Roman physicians. Results from molecular studies have confirmed that although the causative bacteria, <i>B pertussis</i>, is more than several million years old, it rapidly expanded within the human population in the past 500 years when it likely became endemic.">Read more</a>

<p class="mb-0">The name pertussis (from Latin for "intensive cough") was first introduced by the English physician Thomas Sydenham in 1670. This name took over by the end of the decade. Earlier names included hooping cough, tusis perennis, tussis epidemica infantum, and tusis quinta.

However, over the years pertussis had several different names including: 

<ul>
    <li>The <b>Kink</b> or <b>Kinkhoest</b>: These are old Scotish and Dutch terms refering to a 'spasmodic cough'.</li>
    <li><b>Coqueluche</b>, <b>Tusse Convulsa</b> or <b>Tos Ferina</b>: These are French, Spanish and Italian names respectively, referring to the convulsive or ferine (wild, feral) nature of the cough.</li>
    <li><b>Hundred Day Cough</b>: This name, that is still common in many parts of Asia, comes from the observation that the cough can last up to 100 days or more.</li>

<p class="mb-0">In 1982 negative publicity was encouraged from a documentary called "DPT: Vaccine Roulette", which led to a massive amount of lawsuits against the vaccine manufacturers.

It focused on the side effects of the DPT vaccine and showcased families who believed their children had severe neurological side effects. Later shown to be unlinked to vaccination. </br></br>

However, the documentary had significant consequences. It triggered concern and fear about the DPT vaccine among parents, leading to some opting out of vaccinations. It also helped spawn the modern anti-vaccine movement and was directly responsible for the creation of the advocacy group Dissatisfied Parents Together (which later became the National Vaccine Information Center), one of the first organized groups promoting vaccine skepticism.</br></br>

Critically, extensive research has repeatedly confirmed the overall safety and importance of the DPT vaccine and its later version, DTaP, that has fewer side effects. These vaccines have saved countless lives and potential side effects are carefully monitored and studied by healthcare professionals and researchers.
